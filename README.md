# Langara Front End Development Course Description Website

[Website](http://arbutuscreative.ca/darthvadur/langara-courses/)

I created this website so prospective students could get more information about the courses I teach at [Langara College Continuous Studies](http://www.langara.bc.ca/continuing-studies/programs-and-courses/programs/web-technologies/index.html).

I currently teach four courses (as of April 2014):

1. [CSS Fundamentals](http://arbutuscreative.ca/darthvadur/langara-courses/css/)
2. [CSS3 and Responsive Web Design](http://arbutuscreative.ca/darthvadur/langara-courses/css3/)
3. [Improving HTML/CSS Development Workflows](http://arbutuscreative.ca/darthvadur/langara-courses/html-css-workflows) 
4. [HTML5 and Web Applications](http://arbutuscreative.ca/darthvadur/langara-courses/html5/)
5. WordPress Theme Development
