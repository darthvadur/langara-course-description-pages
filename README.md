# Langara Front End Development Course Description Website

Website: [http://davearthurweb.com/courses/](http://davearthurweb.com/courses/)

I currently teach four courses (as of April 2014):

1) [CSS Fundamentals](http://davearthurweb.com/courses/css/)
2) [CSS3 and Responsive Web Design](http://davearthurweb.com/courses/css3/)
